Note About Forward-Looking Statements

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These include, among other things, statements regarding:
•

the growth of our business and revenues and our expectations about the factors that influence our success
and trends in our business;

•

fluctuations in our revenues and margins and various factors contributing to such fluctuations;

•

our expectation that the continuing shift from an offline to online world will continue to benefit our business;

•

our expectation that the portion of our revenues that we derive beyond advertising will continue to increase
and may affect our margins;

•

our expectation that our traffic acquisition costs (TAC) and the associated TAC rate will fluctuate, which
could affect our overall margins;

•

our expectation that our monetization trends will fluctuate, which could affect our revenues and margins;

•

fluctuations in paid clicks and cost-per-click as well as impressions and cost-per-impression, and various
factors contributing to such fluctuations;

•

our expectation that we will continue to periodically review, refine, and update our methodologies for
monitoring, gathering, and counting the number of paid clicks and impressions;

•

our expectation that our results will be affected by our performance in international markets as users in
developing economies increasingly come online;

•

our expectation that our foreign exchange risk management program will not fully offset our net exposure to
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;

•

the expected variability of gains and losses related to hedging activities under our foreign exchange risk
management program;

•

the amount and timing of revenue recognition from customer contracts with commitments for performance
obligations, including our estimate of the remaining amount of commitments and when we expect to
recognize revenue;

•

our expectation that our capital expenditures will increase, including the expected increase in our technical
infrastructure investment to support the growth of our business and our long-term initiatives, in particular in
support of artificial intelligence (AI) products and services;

•

our plans to continue to invest in new businesses, products, services and technologies, and systems, as
well as to continue to invest in acquisitions and strategic investments;

•

our pace of hiring and our plans to provide competitive compensation programs;

•

our expectation that our cost of revenues, research and development (R&D) expenses, sales and marketing
expenses, and general and administrative expenses may increase in amount and/or may increase as a
percentage of revenues and may be affected by a number of factors;

•

estimates of our future compensation expenses;

•

our expectation that our other income (expense), net (OI&E), will fluctuate in the future, as it is largely
driven by market dynamics;

•

our expectation that our effective tax rate and cash tax payments could increase in future years;

•

seasonal fluctuations in internet usage and advertiser expenditures, underlying business trends such as
traditional retail seasonality, which are likely to cause fluctuations in our quarterly results;

•

the sufficiency of our sources of funding;

•

our potential exposure in connection with new and pending investigations, proceedings, and other
contingencies, including the possibility that certain legal proceedings to which we are a party could harm
our business, financial condition, and operating results;

•

our expectation that we will continue to face heightened regulatory scrutiny, and changes in regulatory
conditions, laws, and public policies, which could affect our business practices and financial results;

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Nature of Operations
Google was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in
August 2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc.
("Alphabet") became the successor issuer to Google.
We generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that
provide enterprise customers with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration
tools; sales of other products and services, such as fees received for subscription-based products, apps and in-app
purchases, and devices.
Basis of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated
under the variable interest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
Unaudited Interim Financial Information
These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), and in our opinion, include all adjustments of a normal
recurring nature necessary for fair financial statement presentation. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of
the results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2024. We have made estimates and assumptions
that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual
results could differ materially from these estimates.
These consolidated financial statements and other information presented in this Form 10-Q should be read in
conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form
10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update
(ASU) 2023-07 "Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures" which expands
annual and interim disclosure requirements for reportable segments, primarily through enhanced disclosures about
significant segment expenses. ASU 2023-07 is effective for our annual periods beginning January 1, 2024, and for
interim periods beginning January 1, 2025, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential
effect that the updated standard will have on our financial statement disclosures.
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 "Income Taxes (Topics 740): Improvements to Income Tax
Disclosures" to expand the disclosure requirements for income taxes. Upon adoption we will be required to disclose
standardized categories in the rate reconciliation in both percentage and dollar amounts. ASU 2023-09 will also
require income taxes paid to be disaggregated by jurisdiction, among other disclosure requirements. We will adopt
ASU 2023-09 for our annual periods beginning January 1, 2025.
Prior Period Reclassifications
Certain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation.

Revenue Backlog
As of September 30, 2024, we had $86.8 billion of remaining performance obligations (“revenue backlog”),
primarily related to Google Cloud. Our revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future
services that have not yet been recognized as revenue. The estimated revenue backlog and timing of revenue
recognition for these commitments is largely driven by our ability to deliver in accordance with relevant contract
terms and when our customers utilize services. We expect to recognize approximately half of the revenue backlog
as revenues over the next 24 months with the remainder to be recognized thereafter. Revenue backlog includes
related deferred revenue currently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes
contracts with an original expected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts.
Deferred Revenues
We record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance,
including amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google
subscriptions, platforms, and devices. Total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2023 was $5.0 billion, of which
$3.4 billion was recognized as revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

or inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets.
Debt securities are measured at fair value and classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, because we
use quoted market prices to the extent available or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market
observable inputs to determine fair value. For certain marketable debt securities, we have elected the fair value
option for which changes in fair value are recorded in OI&E. The fair value option was elected for these securities to
align with the unrealized gains and losses from related derivative contracts.

Investments Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis
Our non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable
market values. The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities is adjusted to fair value upon observable
transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment. Non-marketable equity securities
that have been remeasured during the period based on observable transactions are classified within Level 2 or
Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured due to impairment
are classified within Level 3. Our valuation methods include option pricing models, market comparable approach,
and common stock equivalent method, which may include a combination of the observable transaction price at the
transaction date and other unobservable inputs including volatility, expected time to exit, risk free rate, and the
rights, and obligations of the securities we hold. These inputs significantly vary based on investment type.
As of September 30, 2024, the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities was $33.7 billion, of
which $13.7 billion were remeasured at fair value during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and were
primarily classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy at the time of measurement.

of $599 million and $1.9 billion of upward adjustments and $783 million and $412 million of downward adjustments
(including impairments) for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively, and $1.6 billion and $5.0
billion of upward adjustments and $2.3 billion and $2.0 billion of downward adjustments (including impairments) for the
nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively.

In the table above, realized net gain (loss) on equity securities sold during the period reflects the difference
between the sale proceeds and the carrying value of the equity securities at the beginning of the period or the
purchase date, if later.
Cumulative net gains (losses) on equity securities sold during the period, which is summarized in the following
table (in millions), represents the total net gains (losses) recognized after the initial purchase date of the equity
security sold during the period. While these net gains (losses) may have been reflected in periods prior to the period
of sale, we believe they are important supplemental information as they reflect the economic net gains (losses) on
the securities sold during the period. Cumulative net gains (losses) are calculated as the difference between the
sale price and the initial purchase price for the equity security sold during the period.

Alphabet Inc.

Equity Securities Accounted for Under the Equity Method
As of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, equity securities accounted for under the equity method
had a carrying value of approximately $1.7 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively. Our share of gains and losses,
including impairments, are included as a component of OI&E, in the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note
6 for further details on OI&E. Certain of our equity method securities include our investments in VIEs where we are
not the primary beneficiary. See Note 4 for further details on VIEs.
Convertible Notes
As of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, we had investments in convertible notes of $921 million
and $2.8 billion, respectively, majority of which are convertible notes held for investment. Our convertible notes held
for investment are recorded at amortized cost which includes unpaid principal balances, deferred origination costs,
and any related discount or premium, net of allowances for credit losses, and are included within other non-current
assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Derivative Financial Instruments
We use derivative instruments to manage risks relating to our ongoing business operations. The primary risk
managed is foreign exchange risk. We use foreign currency contracts to reduce the risk that our cash flows,
earnings, and investment in foreign subsidiaries will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate
fluctuations. We also enter into derivative instruments to partially offset our exposure to other risks and enhance
investment returns.
We recognize derivative instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classify the
derivatives primarily within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. We present our collar contracts (an option strategy
comprised of a combination of purchased and written options) at net fair values and present all other derivatives at
gross fair values. The accounting treatment for derivatives is based on the intended use and hedge designation.
Cash Flow Hedges
We designate foreign currency forward and option contracts (including collars) as cash flow hedges to hedge
certain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the United States (U.S.) dollar. These
contracts have maturities of 24 months or less.
Cash flow hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI and
subsequently reclassified to revenue when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We exclude forward points
and time value from our assessment of hedge effectiveness and amortize them on a straight-line basis over the life
of the hedging instrument in revenues. The difference between fair value changes of the excluded component and
the amount amortized to revenues is recorded in AOCI.
As of September 30, 2024, the net accumulated loss on our foreign currency cash flow hedges before tax
effect was $433 million, which is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into revenues within the next 12 months.
Fair Value Hedges
We designate foreign currency forward contracts as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our
marketable securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fair value hedge amounts included in
the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OI&E, along with the offsetting gains and losses of the
related hedged items. We exclude forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize
changes in the excluded component in OI&E.
Net Investment Hedges
We designate foreign currency forward contracts as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks
related to our investment in foreign subsidiaries. Net investment hedge amounts included in the assessment of
hedge effectiveness are recognized in AOCI along with the foreign currency translation adjustment. We exclude
forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in
OI&E.
Other Derivatives
We enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to
hedge intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the
functional currency of a subsidiary. Gains and losses on these derivatives that are not designated as accounting
hedges are primarily recorded in OI&E along with the foreign currency gains and losses on monetary assets and
liabilities.
17

We also use derivatives not designated as hedging instruments to manage risks relating to interest rates,
commodity prices, and credit exposures, and to enhance investment returns. From time to time, we enter into
derivatives to hedge the market price risk on certain of our marketable equity securities. Gains and losses arising
from other derivatives are primarily reflected within the “other” component of OI&E. See Note 6 for further details.

Offsetting of Derivatives
We enter into master netting arrangements and collateral security arrangements to reduce credit risk. Cash
collateral received related to derivative instruments under our collateral security arrangements are included in other
current assets with a corresponding liability. Cash and non-cash collateral pledged related to derivative instruments
under our collateral security arrangements are included in other current assets.
The gross amounts of derivative instruments subject to master netting arrangements with various
counterparties, and cash and non-cash collateral received and pledged under such agreements were as follows (in

Note 4.

Variable Interest Entities

Consolidated VIEs
We consolidate VIEs in which we hold a variable interest and are the primary beneficiary. The results of
operations and financial position of these VIEs are included in our consolidated financial statements.
For certain consolidated VIEs, their assets are not available to us, and their creditors do not have recourse to
us. As of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, assets that can only be used to settle obligations of these
VIEs were $4.9 billion and $7.8 billion, respectively and are primarily included in cash and cash equivalents on our
Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, liabilities for which creditors only
have recourse to the VIEs were $2.5 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively. We may continue to fund ongoing
operations of certain VIEs that are included within Other Bets.
Waymo, a fully autonomous driving technology company and a consolidated VIE, received $4.8 billion in
funding during the three months ended September 30, 2024, followed by an additional $860 million in October 2024.
The majority of the total funding of $5.6 billion was provided by Alphabet. Investments from external parties were
accounted for as equity transactions and resulted in recognition of noncontrolling interests.
As of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, total noncontrolling interests (NCI) in our consolidated
subsidiaries were $3.4 billion, of which $1.1 billion was redeemable noncontrolling interests (RNCI) for both periods.
NCI and RNCI are included within additional paid-in capital. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was not
material for any period presented and is included within the "other" component of OI&E. See Note 6 for further
details on OI&E.
Unconsolidated VIEs
We have investments in VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary. These VIEs include private
companies that are primarily early stage companies and certain renewable energy entities in which activities involve
power generation using renewable sources.
We have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that
would significantly affect their economic performance. Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary, and the results
of operations and financial position of these VIEs are not included in our consolidated financial statements. We
account for these investments primarily as non-marketable equity securities or equity method investments, which
are included within non-marketable securities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The maximum exposure of
these unconsolidated VIEs is generally based on the current carrying value of the investments and any future
funding commitments. As of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, our future funding commitments related
to unconsolidated VIE investments were $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively.
Note 5.

Debt

Short-Term Debt
We have a debt financing program of up to $10.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net
proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. We had no commercial paper outstanding as
of December 31, 2023 and $1.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding with a weighted-average effective interest
rate of 4.8% as of September 30, 2024. The estimated fair value of the commercial paper approximated its carrying
value as of September 30, 2024.

Future finance lease payments are net of imputed interest.
Total current portion of long-term debt is included within accrued expenses and other current liabilities. See Note 6 for
further details.

The notes in the table above are fixed-rate senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with each other. We
may redeem the notes at any time in whole or in part at specified redemption prices. The effective interest rates are
based on proceeds received with interest payable semi-annually.
The total estimated fair value of the outstanding notes was approximately $10.3 billion and $9.5 billion as of
December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, respectively. The fair value was determined based on observable
market prices of identical instruments in less active markets and is categorized accordingly as Level 2 in the fair
value hierarchy.
Credit Facility
As of September 30, 2024, we had $10.0 billion of revolving credit facilities, of which $4.0 billion expires in April
2025 and $6.0 billion expires in April 2028. The interest rates for all credit facilities are determined based on a
formula using certain market rates, as well as our progress toward the achievement of certain sustainability goals.
No amounts were outstanding under the credit facilities as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024.

expenses and other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, as we provided bank guarantees (in lieu of a
cash payment) for the fines. Amounts include the effects of foreign exchange and interest. In the third quarter of 2024 we
made a cash payment of $3.0 billion for the 2017 EC shopping fine. See Note 9 for further details.

Business Combinations

character.ai
In accordance with the accounting requirements under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 805, during
the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded $2.7 billion of goodwill and $413 million of intangible
assets resulting from a transaction with character.ai (“Character”). In August 2024, we entered into a license
agreement with Character pursuant to which we obtained a non-exclusive license to its current large language
model technology. We paid Character $2.7 billion in cash and canceled our convertible instruments. We also hired
certain employees of Character. Goodwill was recorded in Google Services and Google Cloud and is deductible for
tax purposes.

Commitments and Contingencies

Commitments
We have content licensing agreements with future fixed or minimum guaranteed commitments of $9.2 billion as
of September 30, 2024, of which the majority is paid quarterly through the first quarter of 2030.
Indemnifications
In the normal course of business, including to facilitate transactions in our services and products and corporate
activities, we indemnify certain parties, including advertisers, Google Network partners, distribution partners,
customers of Google Cloud offerings, lessors, and service providers with respect to certain matters. We have
agreed to defend and/or hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or
covenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties. Several of these
agreements limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In
addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain
similar indemnification obligations to our agents.
It is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification
agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally, the
payments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of
operations, cash flows, or financial position. However, to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the
future, future payments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations or cash flows in a particular period.
As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or
reasonably possible.
Legal Matters
We record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred, and the amount can be
reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be
estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. We evaluate developments in our legal matters that could
affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible
losses disclosed, and make adjustments as appropriate.
Certain outstanding matters seek speculative, substantial or indeterminate monetary amounts, substantial
changes to our business practices and products, or structural remedies. Significant judgment is required to
determine both the likelihood of there being a loss and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters, and
we may be unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of losses. The outcomes of outstanding legal
25

matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, and could, either individually or in
aggregate, have a material adverse effect.
We expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred.
Antitrust Matters
On November 30, 2010, the EC's Directorate General for Competition opened an investigation into various
antitrust-related complaints against us.
•

On June 27, 2017, the EC announced its decision that certain actions taken by Google regarding its display
and ranking of shopping search results and ads infringed European competition law. The EC decision
imposed a €2.4 billion ($2.7 billion as of June 27, 2017) fine. We appealed the EC decision and
implemented product changes to bring shopping ads into compliance with the EC's decision. On September
10, 2024, the European Court of Justice rejected our appeal and upheld the €2.4 billion fine imposed in
2017. In the third quarter of 2024, we made a cash payment of $3.0 billion for the 2017 shopping fine.

•

On July 18, 2018, the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google’s Android-related
distribution agreements infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a €4.3 billion ($5.1
billion as of June 30, 2018) fine and directed the termination of the conduct at issue. On October 9, 2018,
we appealed the EC decision, and on October 29, 2018, we implemented changes to certain of our Android
distribution practices. On September 14, 2022, the General Court reduced the fine from €4.3 billion to
€4.1 billion. We subsequently filed an appeal with the European Court of Justice. In 2018, we recognized a
charge of $5.1 billion for the fine, which we reduced by $217 million in 2022.

•

On March 20, 2019, the EC announced its decision that certain contractual provisions in agreements that
Google had with AdSense for Search partners infringed European competition law. The EC decision
imposed a fine of €1.5 billion ($1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019) and directed actions related to AdSense for
Search partners' agreements, which we implemented prior to the decision. On June 4, 2019, we appealed
the EC decision. We recognized a charge of $1.7 billion for the fine in the first quarter of 2019. On
September 18, 2024, the European Union’s (EU) General Court overturned the EC decision and annulled
the €1.5 billion fine. The EC has until November 28, 2024 to appeal the decision.

In addition, on July 7, 2021, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District
Court for the Northern District of California, alleging that Google’s operation of Android and Google Play violated
U.S. antitrust laws and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. In September 2023, we reached a settlement
in principle with 50 state Attorneys General and three territories. The U.S. District Court subsequently vacated the
trial date with the states, and we expect any final approval of the settlement would come in 2024. In May 2024, we
funded the settlement amount to an escrow agent.
In December 2023, a California jury delivered a verdict in a similar lawsuit in Epic Games v. Google. The jury
found that Google violated antitrust laws related to Google Play's business. Epic did not seek monetary damages.
The presiding judge issued a remedies decision on October 7, 2024, ordering a variety of alterations to our business
models and operations and contractual agreements for Android and Google Play. We are appealing and have filed a
motion to pause the implementation of some of the remedies pending the appeal. The trial court judge has
temporarily paused the implementation of the remedies while the Court of Appeals considers our request to pause
implementation of the remedies pending the duration of the appeal.
From time to time we are subject to formal and informal inquiries and investigations on various competition
matters by regulatory authorities in the U.S., Europe, and other jurisdictions globally. Examples, for which given their
nature we cannot estimate a possible loss include:
•

In August 2019, we began receiving civil investigative demands from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ)
requesting information and documents relating to our prior antitrust investigations and certain aspects of our
business. The DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the
District of Columbia on October 20, 2020 alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to Search
and Search advertising. The trial ended on November 16, 2023, and on August 5, 2024, the U.S. District
Court for the District of Columbia ruled that Google violated such antitrust laws. A separate proceeding is
being held to determine remedies, the range of which vary widely. The DOJ has proposed a high level
remedy framework, which includes alterations to our products and services and our business models and
operations, including structural remedies, and/or our distribution arrangements, among other changes,
some of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements. Further, in June 2022, the
Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and the United Kingdom's Competition and
Markets Authority (CMA) each opened an investigation into Search distribution practices.

26

•

On December 16, 2020, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District
Court for the Eastern District of Texas, alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws as well as state
deceptive trade laws relating to its advertising technology, and a trial is scheduled for March 2025.
Additionally, on January 24, 2023, the DOJ, along with a number of state Attorneys General, filed an
antitrust complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia alleging that Google’s digital
advertising technology products violate U.S. antitrust laws, and on April 17, 2023, a number of additional
state Attorneys General joined the complaint. The trial ended on September 27, 2024, and we expect a
decision in late 2024 or early 2025. The EC, the CMA, and the ACCC each opened a formal investigation
into Google's advertising technology business practices on June 22, 2021, May 25, 2022, and June 29,
2022, respectively. On June 14, 2023, the EC issued a Statement of Objections (SO) informing Google of its
preliminary view that Google violated European antitrust laws relating to its advertising technology. We
responded to the SO on December 1, 2023. On September 6, 2024, the CMA issued an SO informing
Google of its preliminary view that Google violated UK competition laws relating to its advertising
technology. We will respond to the SO.

•

In May 2022, the EC and the CMA each opened investigations into Google Play’s business practices. The
EC closed its initial investigation, but is now investigating Google Play’s compliance with certain provisions
of EU’s Digital Markets Act. Korean regulators are investigating Google Play's billing practices, including a
formal review in May 2022 of Google's compliance with the new app store billing regulations.

We believe we have strong arguments against these claims and will defend ourselves vigorously. We continue
to cooperate with federal and state regulators in the U.S., the EC, and other regulators around the world.
Privacy Matters
We are subject to a number of privacy-related laws and regulations, and we currently are party to a number of
privacy investigations and lawsuits ongoing in multiple jurisdictions. For example, there are ongoing investigations
and litigation in the U.S. and the EU, including those relating to our collection and use of location information, the
choices we offer users, and advertising practices, which could result in significant fines, judgments, and product
changes.
Patent and Intellectual Property Claims
We have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that
certain of our products, services, and technologies infringe others' intellectual property rights. Adverse results in
these lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or
orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have
to change our business practices and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss
of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has
increasingly become an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC
action can result in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important
market, a prohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing
many important products into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.
Furthermore, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them against
certain intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such
claims, and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. In
addition, our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a
result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business.
Other
We are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and consent
orders involving competition, intellectual property, data security, tax and related compliance, labor and employment,
commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using
our platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters. For example, we periodically have data
incidents that we report to relevant regulators as required by law. Such claims, consent orders, lawsuits, regulatory
and government investigations, and other proceedings could result in substantial fines and penalties, injunctive
relief, ongoing monitoring and auditing obligations, changes to our products and services, alterations to our
business models and operations, and collateral related civil litigation or other adverse consequences, all of which
could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.

27

We have ongoing legal matters relating to Russia. For example, civil judgments that include compounding
penalties have been imposed upon us in connection with disputes regarding the termination of accounts, including
those of sanctioned parties. We do not believe these ongoing legal matters will have a material adverse effect.
Non-Income Taxes
We are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to non-income tax matters.
The subject matter of non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied
to the sale of our products and services in these jurisdictions and the tax treatment of certain employee benefits. We
accrue non-income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax
authorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and
the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. Due to the inherent complexity
and uncertainty of these matters and judicial process in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome may be materially
different from our expectations.
See Note 13 for information regarding income tax contingencies.
Note 10.

Stockholders' Equity

Share Repurchases
In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we continued to repurchase both Class A and Class
C shares in a manner deemed in the best interest of the company and its stockholders, taking into account the
economic cost and prevailing market conditions, including the relative trading prices and volumes of the Class A and
Class C shares. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased $15.3 billion and
$47.0 billion, respectively, of Alphabet's Class A and Class C shares.
In April 2023, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to $70.0 billion of its
Class A and Class C shares. Repurchases made pursuant to the April 2023 authorization were completed during the
third quarter of 2024. In April 2024, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to
an additional $70.0 billion of its Class A and Class C shares. As of September 30, 2024, $59.7 billion remained
available for Class A and Class C share repurchases.

Dividends
During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, total cash dividends were $1.2 billion and
$2.3 billion for Class A, $173 million and $346 million for Class B, and $1.1 billion and $2.2 billion for Class C
shares, respectively.
The company intends to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future, subject to review and approval by the
company’s Board of Directors in its sole discretion.

For the periods presented above, the holders of each class are entitled to equal per share dividends or
distributions in liquidation in accordance with the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Alphabet Inc.
Holders of Alphabet unvested stock units are awarded dividend equivalents, which are subject to the same vesting
conditions as the underlying award, and settled in Class C shares.
Immaterial differences in net income per share across our Class A, Class B, and Class C shares may arise due
to the allocation of distributed earnings based on the holders as of the record date, compared with the allocation of
undistributed earnings and number of shares based on weighted average over the periods.

Compensation Plans

Stock-Based Compensation
For the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, total stock based compensation (SBC) expense
was $5.8 billion and $5.9 billion, including amounts associated with awards we expect to settle in Alphabet stock of
$5.6 billion and $5.7 billion, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, total SBC
expense was $16.5 billion and $17.0 billion, including amounts associated with awards we expect to settle in
Alphabet stock of $16.3 billion and $16.4 billion, respectively.
Stock-Based Award Activities

We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in
evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. The total amount of gross
unrecognized tax benefits was $9.4 billion and $12.0 billion, of which $7.4 billion and $9.5 billion, if recognized,
would affect our effective tax rate, as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, respectively.

Information about Segments and Geographic Areas

We report our segment results as Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets:
•

Google Services includes products and services such as ads, Android, Chrome, devices, Google Maps,
Google Play, Search, and YouTube. Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; fees
received for consumer subscription-based products such as YouTube TV, YouTube Music and Premium,
and NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One; the sale of apps and in-app purchases and devices.

•

Google Cloud includes infrastructure and platform services, collaboration tools, and other services for
enterprise customers. Google Cloud generates revenues primarily from consumption-based fees and
subscriptions received for Google Cloud Platform services, Google Workspace communication and
collaboration tools, and other enterprise services.

•

Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues
from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related services and internet services.

Revenues, certain costs, such as costs associated with content and traffic acquisition, certain engineering
activities, and devices, as well as certain operating expenses are directly attributable to our segments. Due to the
integrated nature of Alphabet, other costs and expenses, such as technical infrastructure and office facilities, are
31

managed centrally at a consolidated level. These costs, including the associated depreciation and impairment, are
allocated to operating segments as a service cost generally based on usage, headcount, or revenue.
As announced on April 18, 2024, we further consolidated teams that focus on building AI models across
Google Research and Google DeepMind to further accelerate our progress in AI. AI model development teams
previously under Google Research in our Google Services segment are included as part of Google DeepMind,
reported within Alphabet-level activities, prospectively beginning in the second quarter of 2024.
Certain costs are not allocated to our segments because they represent Alphabet-level activities. These costs
primarily include AI-focused shared R&D activities, including development costs of our general AI models; corporate
initiatives such as our philanthropic activities; corporate shared costs such as certain finance, human resource, and
legal costs, including certain fines and settlements. Charges associated with employee severance and office space
reductions during 2023 and 2024 were also not allocated to our segments. Additionally, hedging gains (losses)
related to revenue are not allocated to our segments.
Our operating segments are not evaluated using asset information.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS

Please read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together
with "Note About Forward-Looking Statements" and our consolidated financial statements and related notes
included under Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as well as our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, including Part I, Item 1A "Risk Factors," as updated in our Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 and in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Understanding Alphabet’s Financial Results
Alphabet is a collection of businesses — the largest of which is Google. We report Google in two segments,
Google Services and Google Cloud; we also report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. For further
details on our segments, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Revenues and Monetization Metrics
We generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that
provide enterprise customers of all sizes with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and
collaboration tools; sales of other products and services, such as fees received for subscription-based products,
apps and in-app purchases, and devices. For additional information on how we recognize revenue, see Note 1 of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.
In addition to the long-term trends and their financial effect on our business discussed in "Trends in Our
Business and Financial Effect" in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2023, fluctuations in our revenues have been and may continue to be affected by a combination of
factors, including:
•

changes in foreign currency exchange rates;

•

changes in pricing, such as those resulting from changes in fee structures, discounts, and customer
incentives;

•

general economic conditions and various external dynamics, including geopolitical events, regulations, and
other measures and their effect on advertiser, consumer, and enterprise spending;

•

new product and service launches; and

•

seasonality.

Additionally, fluctuations in our revenues generated from advertising ("Google advertising"), revenues from
other sources ("Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues"), Google Cloud, and Other Bets revenues
have been, and may continue to be, affected by other factors unique to each set of revenues, as described below.
Google Services
Google Services revenues consist of Google advertising as well as Google subscriptions, platforms, and
devices revenues.
Google Advertising
Google advertising revenues are comprised of the following:
•

Google Search & other, which includes revenues generated on Google search properties (including
revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners who use Google.com as their default search
in browsers, toolbars, etc.), and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and
Google Play;

•

YouTube ads, which includes revenues generated on YouTube properties; and

•

Google Network, which includes revenues generated on Google Network properties participating in AdMob,
AdSense, and Google Ad Manager.

We use certain metrics to track how well traffic across various properties is monetized as it relates to our
advertising revenues: paid clicks and cost-per-click pertain to traffic on Google Search & other properties, while
impressions and cost-per-impression pertain to traffic on our Google Network properties.

33

Paid clicks represent engagement by users and include clicks on advertisements by end-users on Google
search properties and other Google owned and operated properties including Gmail, Google Maps, and Google
Play. Cost-per-click is defined as click-driven revenues divided by our total number of paid clicks and represents the
average amount we charge advertisers for each engagement by users.
Impressions include impressions displayed to users on Google Network properties participating primarily in
AdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager. Cost-per-impression is defined as impression-based and click-based
revenues divided by our total number of impressions, and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for
each impression displayed to users.
As our business evolves, we periodically review, refine, and update our methodologies for monitoring,
gathering, and counting the number of paid clicks and the number of impressions, and for identifying the revenues
generated by the corresponding click and impression activity.
Fluctuations in our advertising revenues, as well as the change in paid clicks and cost-per-click on Google
Search & other properties and the change in impressions and cost-per-impression on Google Network properties
and the correlation between these items have been, and may continue to be, affected by factors in addition to the
general factors described above, such as:
•

advertiser competition for keywords;

•

changes in advertising quality, formats, delivery or policy;

•

changes in device mix;

•

seasonal fluctuations in internet usage, advertising expenditures, and underlying business trends, such as
traditional retail seasonality; and

•

traffic growth in emerging markets compared to more mature markets and across various verticals and
channels.
Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices
Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues are comprised of the following:

•

consumer subscriptions, which primarily include revenues from YouTube services, such as YouTube TV,
YouTube Music and Premium, and NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One;

•

platforms, which primarily include revenues from Google Play from the sales of apps and in-app purchases;

•

devices, which primarily include sales of the Pixel family of devices; and

•

other products and services.

Fluctuations in our Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues have been, and may continue to be,
affected by factors in addition to the general factors described above, such as changes in customer usage and
demand, number of subscribers, and fluctuations in the timing of product launches.
Google Cloud
Google Cloud revenues are comprised of the following:
•

Google Cloud Platform, which generates consumption-based fees and subscriptions for infrastructure,
platform, and other services. These services provide access to solutions such as cybersecurity, databases,
analytics, and AI offerings including our AI infrastructure, Vertex AI platform, and Gemini for Google Cloud;

•

Google Workspace, which includes subscriptions for cloud-based communication and collaboration tools for
enterprises, such as Calendar, Gmail, Docs, Drive, and Meet, with integrated features like Gemini for
Google Workspace; and

•

other enterprise services.

Fluctuations in our Google Cloud revenues have been, and may continue to be, affected by factors in addition
to the general factors described above, such as customer usage.
Other Bets
Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related services and internet
services.

34

Costs and Expenses
Our cost structure has two components: cost of revenues and operating expenses. Our operating expenses
include costs related to R&D, sales and marketing, and general and administrative functions. Certain of our costs
and expenses, including those associated with the operation of our technical infrastructure as well as components
of our operating expenses, are generally less variable in nature and may not correlate to changes in revenue.
Additionally, fluctuations in compensation expenses may not directly correlate with changes in headcount, in
particular due to annual SBC awards that generally vest over four years.
Cost of Revenues
Cost of revenues is comprised of TAC and other costs of revenues.
•

•

TAC includes:
◦

amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and
services. Our distribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment
manufacturers, and software developers; and

◦

amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.

Other cost of revenues primarily includes:
◦

compensation expense related to our technical infrastructure and other operations such as content
review and customer and product support;

◦

content acquisition costs, which are payments to content providers from whom we license video
and other content for distribution on YouTube and Google Play (we pay fees to these content

◦

depreciation expense related to our technical infrastructure;

◦

inventory and other costs related to the devices we sell; and

◦

other technical infrastructure operations costs, including bandwidth, energy, and equipment costs.

TAC as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Network properties are significantly
higher than TAC as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Search & other properties,
because most of the advertiser revenues from ads served on Google Network properties are paid as TAC to our
Google Network partners.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses are generally incurred during our normal course of business, which we categorize as
either R&D, sales and marketing, or general and administrative.
The main components of our R&D expenses are:
•

compensation expenses for engineering and technical employees responsible for R&D related to our
existing and new products and services;

•

depreciation; and

•

third-party services fees primarily relating to consulting and outsourced services in support of our
engineering and product development efforts.
The main components of our sales and marketing expenses are:

•

compensation expenses for employees engaged in sales and marketing, sales support, and certain
customer service functions; and

•

spending relating to our advertising and promotional activities in support of our products and services.
The main components of our general and administrative expenses are:

•

compensation expenses for employees in finance, human resources, information technology, legal, and
other administrative support functions;

•

expenses relating to legal matters, including certain fines and settlements; and

•

third-party services fees, including audit, consulting, outside legal, and other outsourced administrative
services.

Other Income (Expense), Net
OI&E, net primarily consists of interest income (expense), the effect of foreign currency exchange gains
(losses), net gains (losses) and impairment on our marketable and non-marketable securities, performance fees,
and income (loss) and impairment from our equity method investments.
For additional information, including how we account for our investments and factors that can drive fluctuations
in the value of our investments, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II,
Item 8 and Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in our Annual Report on Form 10K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 as well as Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Provision for Income Taxes
Provision for income taxes represents the estimated amount of federal, state, and foreign income taxes
incurred in the U.S. and the many jurisdictions in which we operate. The provision includes the effect of reserve
provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties.
For additional information, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II,

•

Revenues were $88.3 billion, an increase of 15% year over year, primarily driven by an increase in Google
Services revenues of $8.5 billion, or 13%, and an increase in Google Cloud revenues of $2.9 billion, or
35%.

•

Total constant currency revenues, which exclude the effect of hedging, increased 16% year over year.

•

Cost of revenues was $36.5 billion, an increase of 10% year over year, primarily driven by increases in TAC,
content acquisition costs, depreciation expense, and devices costs due to Pixel family product launch timing
in the third quarter this year as compared to the fourth quarter last year.

•

Operating expenses were $23.3 billion, an increase of 5% year over year, primarily driven by charges
related to our office space optimization efforts and increases in depreciation expense, compensation
36

expenses, and advertising and promotional activities. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in
charges related to legal and other matters.

Google advertising revenues
Google Search & other
Google Search & other revenues increased $5.4 billion and $17.0 billion from the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2023 to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The overall growth was
driven by interrelated factors including increases in search queries resulting from growth in user adoption and usage
on mobile devices; growth in advertiser spending; and improvements we have made in ad formats and delivery.
YouTube ads
YouTube ads revenues increased $969 million and $3.4 billion from the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2023 to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The growth was driven
by our brand advertising products followed by our direct response advertising products, both of which benefited from
increased spending by our advertisers.

37

Google Network
Google Network revenues decreased $121 million from the three months ended September 30, 2023 to the
three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily driven by the unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange
rates, partially offset by an increase in AdSense revenues.
Google Network revenues decreased $610 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the
nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily driven by the unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange
rates as well as a decrease in AdMob revenues.
Monetization Metrics
The following table presents changes in monetization metrics for Google Search & other revenues (paid clicks
and cost-per-click) and Google Network revenues (impressions and cost-per-impression), expressed as a

Changes in paid clicks and impressions are driven by a number of interrelated factors, including changes in
advertiser spending; ongoing product and policy changes; and, as it relates to paid clicks, fluctuations in search
queries resulting from changes in user adoption and usage, primarily on mobile devices.
Changes in cost-per-click and cost-per-impression are driven by a number of interrelated factors including
changes in device mix, geographic mix, advertiser spending, ongoing product and policy changes, product mix,
property mix, and changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices
Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues increased $2.3 billion and $4.8 billion from the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively.
The growth was primarily driven by increases in subscriptions and devices revenues. The increase in subscriptions
revenues was largely from growth in the number of paid subscribers for YouTube services and to a lesser extent for
Google One. The increase in devices revenues was primarily driven by increased sales of Pixel devices, due to
Pixel family product launch timing in the third quarter this year as compared to the fourth quarter last year.
Google Cloud
Google Cloud revenues increased $2.9 billion and $7.4 billion from the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2023 to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The growth was
primarily driven by Google Cloud Platform followed by Google Workspace offerings. Google Cloud's infrastructure
and platform services were the largest drivers of growth in Google Cloud Platform.

Use of Non-GAAP Constant Currency Information
International revenues, which represent a significant portion of our revenues, are generally transacted in
multiple currencies and therefore are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
The effect of currency exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period-to-period
comparisons. We use non-GAAP constant currency revenues ("constant currency revenues") and non-GAAP
percentage change in constant currency revenues ("percentage change in constant currency revenues") for
financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe
the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to GAAP results helps improve the ability to
understand our performance, because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of
our core operating results.
Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant
period over period. We define constant currency revenues as revenues excluding the effect of foreign currency
exchange rate movements ("FX Effect") as well as hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated
level. We use constant currency revenues to determine the constant currency revenue percentage change on a
year-on-year basis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior
year comparable period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period.
Constant currency revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the change in current period
revenues over prior year comparable period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are
translated using prior year comparable period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of
both periods.
These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with
GAAP. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled
measures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.

EMEA revenue growth was unfavorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due
to the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Turkish lira.
APAC revenue growth was unfavorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due
to the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Japanese yen.

EMEA revenue growth was not materially affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, as the effect
of the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Turkish lira was largely offset by the U.S. dollar weakening relative to
the British pound.
APAC revenue growth was unfavorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due

Cost of revenues increased $3.2 billion from the three months ended September 30, 2023 to the three months
ended September 30, 2024 due to an increase in other cost of revenues and TAC of $2.2 billion and $1.1 billion,
respectively. Cost of revenues increased $9.9 billion from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 due to an increase in other cost of revenues and TAC of $6.8 billion and $3.2
billion, respectively.
The increase in TAC from the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2024 was largely due to an increase in TAC paid to distribution partners, primarily driven by
growth in revenues subject to TAC. The TAC rate decreased from 21.2% to 20.8% from the three months ended
September 30, 2023 to the three months ended September 30, 2024 and decreased from 21.4% to 20.8% from the
nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to a revenue
mix shift from Google Network properties to Google Search & other properties. The TAC rate on Google Search &
other revenues increased from the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to increases related to mobile searches, which carries higher TAC
because more mobile searches are channeled through paid access points. The TAC rate on Google Network
revenues was substantially consistent from the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2024.
The increase in other cost of revenues from the three months ended September 30, 2023 to the three months
ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to increases in content acquisition costs, largely for YouTube,
depreciation expense, and devices costs, due to Pixel family product launch timing in the third quarter this year as
compared to the fourth quarter last year.
The increase in other cost of revenues from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to increases in content acquisition costs, largely for YouTube,
depreciation expense, other technical infrastructure operations costs, and third-party service fees. Additionally,
devices costs contributed to the increase in other cost of revenues due to the Pixel family product launch timing in
the third quarter this year as compared to the fourth quarter last year.

compensation expenses was largely due to an increase in SBC expense of $214 million.
R&D expenses increased $2.9 billion from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, primarily driven by increases in depreciation expense of $993 million, compensation

was primarily driven by a $1.0 billion increase in SBC expenses, which reflects the reduction in valuation-based
compensation liabilities related to certain Other Bets recognized in the prior year comparable period, partially offset
by a $554 million decrease in severance and related charges.

Google Services
Google Services operating income increased $6.9 billion and $19.3 billion from the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2023 to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The increase in
operating income was primarily driven by an increase in revenues, partially offset by increases in TAC and content
acquisition costs. Additionally, a reduction in compensation expenses contributed to the increase in operating
income.
Google Cloud
Google Cloud operating income increased $1.7 billion and $3.2 billion from the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2023 to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The increase in
operating income was primarily driven by an increase in revenues, partially offset by increases in usage costs for
technical infrastructure assets as well as compensation expenses, largely driven by headcount growth.
Other Bets
Other Bets operating loss decreased $78 million from the three months ended September 30, 2023 to the three
months ended September 30, 2024, due to a combination of factors, none of which were individually significant.
Other Bets operating loss increased $38 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the nine
months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in operating loss was primarily due to an increase in expenses,
largely driven by compensation expenses, partially offset by an increase in revenues. The increase in compensation
expenses was primarily as a result of the reduction in valuation-based compensation liabilities related to certain
Other Bets recognized in the prior year comparable period.

OI&E increased $3.3 billion from the three months ended September 30, 2023 to the three months ended
September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to an increase in net unrealized gains on equity securities
driven by fair value adjustments related to observable transactions and market driven changes, and increased net
gains on debt securities.
OI&E increased $5.4 billion from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the nine months ended
September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to an increase in net unrealized gains on non-marketable
equity securities driven by fair value adjustments related to observable transactions and increased interest income
related to higher interest rates.

The effective tax rate increased from the three months ended September 30, 2023 to the three months ended
September 30, 2024. This increase was primarily due to a cumulative one-time adjustment recorded for tax rule
changes issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the third quarter of 2023. Additionally, a decrease in the
U.S. federal Foreign Derived Intangible Income tax deduction in 2024 contributed to the higher effective tax rate.
The effective tax rate increased from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the nine months ended
September 30, 2024. This increase was primarily due to a one-time adjustment for tax rule changes issued by the
IRS in the third quarter of 2023. Additionally, a decrease in the 2024 U.S. federal Foreign Derived Intangible Income
tax deduction contributed to an increase in the effective tax rate. These factors were partially offset by an increase
in stock-based compensation-related tax benefits in 2024.
The OECD is coordinating negotiations among more than 140 countries with the goal of achieving consensus
around substantial changes to international tax policies, including the implementation of a minimum global effective
tax rate of 15%. Some countries have already implemented the legislation effective January 1, 2024, and we expect
others to follow, however we do not expect a material change to our income tax provision for the 2024 fiscal year. As
additional jurisdictions enact such legislation, transitional rules lapse, and other provisions of the minimum tax
legislation become effective, we expect our effective tax rate and cash tax payments could increase in future years.
Financial Condition
Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities
As of September 30, 2024, we had $93.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term marketable
securities. Cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised of time deposits, money market funds, highly
liquid government bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, and marketable
equity securities.
Sources, Uses of Cash and Related Trends
Our principal sources of liquidity are cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as well as the cash
flow that we generate from operations. The primary use of capital continues to be to invest for the long-term growth
of the business. We regularly evaluate our cash and capital structure, including the size, pace, and form of capital
return to stockholders.
The following table presents our cash flows (in millions):

Cash Provided by Operating Activities
Our largest source of cash provided by operations are advertising revenues generated by Google Search &
other properties, Google Network properties, and YouTube properties. In Google Services, we also generate cash
through consumer subscriptions, the sale of apps and in-app purchases, and devices. In Google Cloud, we
generate cash through consumption-based fees and subscriptions for infrastructure, platform, collaboration tools,
and other cloud services.
Our primary uses of cash from operating activities include payments to distribution and Google Network
partners, to employees for compensation, and to content providers. Other uses of cash from operating activities
44

include payments to suppliers for devices, to tax authorities for income taxes, and other general corporate
expenditures.
Net cash provided by operating activities increased from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the
nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to an increase in cash received from customers, partially offset by an
increase in tax payments and a cash payment for the 2017 EC shopping fine. The increase in tax payments in
comparison to the prior year comparable period was primarily due to the 2023 IRS payment deferral relief made
available to taxpayers headquartered in designated counties in California.
Cash Used in Investing Activities
Cash provided by investing activities consists primarily of maturities and sales of investments in marketable
and non-marketable securities. Cash used in investing activities consists primarily of purchases of marketable and
non-marketable securities, purchases of property and equipment, and payments for acquisitions and purchases of
intangible assets.
Net cash used in investing activities increased from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to an increase in purchases of property and equipment and
purchases of marketable securities, partially offset by increases in maturities and sales of marketable securities.
Cash Used in Financing Activities
Cash provided by financing activities consists primarily of proceeds from issuance of debt and proceeds from
the sale of interests in consolidated entities. Cash used in financing activities consists primarily of repurchases of
stock, net payments related to stock-based award activities, payment of dividends, and repayments of debt.
Net cash used in financing activities increased from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 due to dividend payments and net payments related to stock-based award
activities.
Liquidity and Material Cash Requirements
We expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, and cash flows from operations
and financing activities to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for
investing and financing activities for at least the next 12 months, and thereafter for the foreseeable future.
Capital Expenditures and Leases
We make investments in land and buildings for data centers and offices and information technology assets
through purchases of property and equipment and lease arrangements to provide capacity for the growth of our
services and products.
Capital Expenditures
Our capital investments in property and equipment consist primarily of the following major categories:
•

technical infrastructure, which consists of our investments in servers and network equipment for computing,
storage, and networking requirements for ongoing business activities, including AI, (collectively referred to
as our information technology assets) and data center land and building construction; and

•

office facilities, ground-up development projects, and building improvements (also referred to as "fit-outs").

Construction in progress consists primarily of technical infrastructure and office facilities which have not yet
been placed in service. The time frame from date of purchase to placement in service of these assets may extend
from months to years. For example, our data center construction projects are generally multi-year projects with
multiple phases, where we acquire land and buildings, construct buildings, and secure and install information
technology assets.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, we spent $21.2 billion and $38.3 billion on
capital expenditures, respectively. We expect to increase, relative to 2023, our investment in our technical
infrastructure, including servers, network equipment, and data centers, to support the growth of our business and
our long-term initiatives, in particular in support of AI products and services. Depreciation of our property and
equipment commences when the deployment of such assets are completed and are ready for our intended use.
Land is not depreciated. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, our depreciation on property
and equipment was $8.6 billion and $11.1 billion, respectively.
Leases

45

For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, we recognized total operating lease assets of $2.4
billion and $1.6 billion, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the amount of total future lease payments under
operating leases, which had a weighted average remaining lease term of 7.8 years, was $17.1 billion.
As of September 30, 2024, we have entered into leases that have not yet commenced with future lease
payments of $6.1 billion, that are not yet recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These leases will
commence between 2024 and 2027 with non-cancelable lease terms of one to 25 years.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, our operating lease expenses (including variable
lease costs) were $3.4 billion and $3.5 billion, respectively. Finance lease costs were not material for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024.
Financing
We have a short-term debt financing program of up to $10.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper.
Net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. As of September 30, 2024, we had $1.0
billion of short-term commercial paper outstanding.
As of September 30, 2024, we had $10.0 billion of revolving credit facilities, $4.0 billion expiring in April 2025
and $6.0 billion expiring in April 2028. The interest rates for all credit facilities are determined based on a formula
using certain market rates, as well as our progress toward the achievement of certain sustainability goals. No
amounts have been borrowed under the credit facilities.
As of September 30, 2024, we had senior unsecured notes outstanding with a total carrying value of $11.9
billion. For additional information, see Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1
of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
We primarily utilize contract manufacturers for the assembly of our servers used in our technical infrastructure
and devices we sell. We have agreements where we may purchase components directly from suppliers and then
supply these components to contract manufacturers for use in the assembly of the servers and devices. Certain of
these arrangements result in a portion of the cash received from and paid to the contract manufacturers to be
presented as financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included in Item 1 of this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q.
Share Repurchase Program
During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased and subsequently retired 90
million and 293 million shares for $15.3 billion and $47.0 billion, respectively.
In April 2023, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to $70.0 billion of its
Class A and Class C shares. Repurchases made pursuant to the April 2023 authorization were completed during the
third quarter of 2024. In April 2024, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to
an additional $70.0 billion of its Class A and Class C shares. As of September 30, 2024, $59.7 billion remained
available for Class A and Class C share repurchases.

Dividend Program
During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, total cash dividends were $1.2 billion and
$2.3 billion for Class A, $173 million and $346 million for Class B, and $1.1 billion and $2.2 billion for Class C
shares, respectively.
The company intends to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future, subject to review and approval by the
company’s Board of Directors in its sole discretion.

European Commission Fines
In 2017, 2018, and 2019, the EC announced decisions that certain actions taken by Google infringed
European competition law and imposed fines of €2.4 billion ($2.7 billion as of June 27, 2017), €4.3 billion ($5.1
billion as of June 30, 2018), and €1.5 billion ($1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019), respectively.
On September 14, 2022, the General Court reduced the 2018 fine from €4.3 billion to €4.1 billion. We
subsequently appealed the General Court's decision to the European Court of Justice.
On September 10, 2024, the European Court of Justice rejected our appeal of the 2017 decision and upheld
the €2.4 billion fine. In the third quarter of 2024, we made a cash payment of $3.0 billion for the 2017 shopping fine.
On September 18, 2024, the EU's General Court overturned the 2019 decision and annulled the €1.5 billion
fine. The EC has until November 28, 2024 to appeal the decision.
We included the EC fines, including any under appeal, in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our
Consolidated Balance Sheets, as we provided bank guarantees (in lieu of a cash payment) for the fines. For
additional information, see Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Taxes
As of September 30, 2024, we had short-term income taxes payable of $2.7 billion, related to a one-time
transition tax payable incurred as a result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("Tax Act"). As permitted by the Tax Act,
we will pay the remaining transition tax installment in 2025. We also have long-term taxes payable of $8.2 billion
primarily related to uncertain tax positions as of September 30, 2024.
Purchase Commitments and Other Contractual Obligations
As of September 30, 2024, we had material purchase commitments and other contractual obligations of $50.8
billion, of which $31.1 billion was short-term. These amounts primarily consist of purchase orders for certain
technical infrastructure as well as the non-cancelable portion or the minimum cancellation fee in certain agreements
related to commitments to purchase licenses, including content licenses, inventory, and network capacity. For those
agreements with variable terms, we do not estimate the non-cancelable obligation beyond any minimum quantities
and/or pricing as of September 30, 2024. In certain instances, the amount of our contractual obligations may
change based on the expected timing of order fulfillment from our suppliers. For more information related to our
content licenses, see Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item I of this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q.
In addition, we regularly enter into multi-year, non-cancellable agreements to purchase renewable energy and
energy attributes, such as renewable energy certificates. These agreements do not include a minimum dollar
commitment. The amounts to be paid under these agreements are based on the actual volumes to be generated
and are not readily determinable.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

For quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, refer to Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,

ITEM 4.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, as of the
end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of
September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are
effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or
submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified
in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter
ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.
Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures
In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls
and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving
the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that
there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of
possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

For a description of our material pending legal proceedings, see Note 9 “Commitments and Contingencies Legal Matters” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q, which is incorporated herein by reference.
ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to
those described in Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2023, as updated in our subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, which could harm our business,
reputation, financial condition, and operating results, and affect the trading price of our Class A and Class C stock.
Below are material changes to our risk factors since our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June
30, 2024.
We are and may continue to be subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government inquiries and
investigations, enforcement actions, consent orders, and other forms of regulatory scrutiny and legal
liability, including competition matters, that could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and
operating results.
We are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government inquiries and investigations, other proceedings,
and orders involving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related compliance, labor
and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers
or publishers using our platforms, personal injury, and other matters.
The DOJ, various U.S. states, and other plaintiffs have filed, and may continue to file in the future, several
antitrust lawsuits about various aspects of our business, including our advertising technologies and practices, the
operation and distribution of Google Search, and the operation and distribution of the Android operating system and
Play Store.
For example, the DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit alleging that Google violated
antitrust laws relating to Search and Search advertising, and in August 2024, the U.S. District Court for the District
of Columbia ruled that Google violated such antitrust laws. The Court is holding a separate proceeding to determine
remedies, which could include alterations to our products and services and our business models and operations,
including structural remedies, and/or our distribution arrangements, among other changes. While we plan to appeal,
there can be no assurance that our appeal will succeed, or that we will be able to change or decrease the severity
of any remedies that may be ordered, and any or all of these potential remedies could harm our business,
reputation, financial condition, and operating results.
Also, in December 2023, a California jury delivered a verdict in Epic Games v. Google finding that Google
violated antitrust laws related to Google Play's business. The presiding judge issued a remedies decision on
October 7, 2024 that ordered a variety of alterations to our business models and operations and contractual
agreements for Android and Google Play. We are appealing and have filed a motion to pause the implementation of
some of the remedies pending the appeal, but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our appeal or
in our efforts to pause the implementation of the remedies pending the appeal. If we are unsuccessful, we could
face significant expenses to implement the remedies, and such costs and alterations could harm our business,
reputation, financial condition, and operating results.
Other regulatory agencies in the U.S. and around the world, including competition enforcers, consumer
protection agencies, and data protection authorities, have challenged and may continue to challenge our business
practices and compliance with laws and regulations. We are cooperating with these investigations and defending
litigation or appealing decisions where appropriate.
We are also subject to a variety of claims including product warranty, product liability, and consumer protection
claims related to product defects, among other litigation, and we may also be subject to claims involving health and
safety, hazardous materials usage, other environmental effects, AI training, development, and commercialization, or
service disruptions or failures. Claims have been brought, and we expect will continue to be brought, against us for
defamation, negligence, breaches of contract, patent, copyright and trademark infringement, unfair competition,
unlawful activity, torts, privacy rights violations, fraud, or other legal theories based on the nature and content of
information available on or via our services, the design and effect of our products and services, or due to our
involvement in hosting, transmitting, marketing, branding, or providing access to content created by third parties.

49

Various laws, regulations, investigations, enforcement lawsuits, and regulatory actions have involved in the
past, and may in the future result in substantial fines and penalties, injunctive relief, ongoing monitoring and auditing
obligations, changes to our products and services, alterations to our business models and operations, including
divestiture, and collateral related civil litigation or other adverse consequences. Any of these legal proceedings
could also result in legal costs, diversion of management resources, and negative publicity, all of which could harm
our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.
Estimating liabilities for our pending proceedings is a complex, fact-specific, and speculative process that
requires significant judgment, and the amounts we are ultimately liable for may be less than or exceed our
estimates. The resolution of one or more such proceedings has resulted in, and may in the future result in,
additional substantial fines, penalties, injunctions, and other sanctions that could harm our business, reputation,
financial condition, and operating results.
For additional information about the ongoing material legal proceedings to which we are subject, see Legal
Proceedings in Part II, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

OTHER INFORMATION

10b5-1 Trading Plans
During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the following Section 16 director adopted, modified, or
terminated a “Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement” (as defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K of the Exchange Act):
•

Frances Arnold, a member of the Board of Directors of Alphabet, adopted a trading plan on July 26, 2024
(with the first trade under the plan scheduled for October 30, 2024). The trading plan will be effective until
November 7, 2025 to sell 50% of the (net) shares resulting from the vesting of 3,345 (gross) shares of Class
C Capital Stock, in addition to 50% of the (net) shares of any future grants awarded during the term of the
plan.

There were no “non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangements” (as defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K of the
Exchange Act) adopted, modified or terminated during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 by our directors and
Section 16 officers. Each of the Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangements are in accordance with our Policy Against Insider
Trading and actual sale transactions made pursuant to such trading arrangements will be disclosed publicly in
Section 16 filings with the SEC in accordance with applicable securities laws, rules, and regulations.
Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
On April 16, 2024, the Leadership Development, Inclusion and Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors of Alphabet approved the accrual of dividend equivalent units to holders of all unvested stock units,
subject to the approval of a dividend declaration by the Board of Directors of the company (which was announced
50

on October 29, 2024). As stock units are not outstanding shares of stock and thus would not otherwise be entitled to
participate in any dividends (including the one referenced above), the crediting of dividend equivalent units is
intended to preserve the equity-based incentives intended by the company when the stock units were granted and
to treat the holders of stock units consistently with all stockholders.
Required Disclosure Pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act
During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, Google LLC, a subsidiary of Alphabet, filed a notification with
the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) pursuant to Russian encryption control requirements, which must be
complied with prior to the import of covered items. Neither we nor our subsidiaries generated any gross revenues or
net profits directly from such activity and neither we nor our subsidiaries sell to the FSB. In the ordinary course of its
business, Alphabet expects that Google LLC will continue to file these notifications as required under Russian law.
